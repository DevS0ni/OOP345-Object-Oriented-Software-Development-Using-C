In this workshop, a multifaceted set of objectives was accomplished, demonstrating a command of advanced programming concepts. Key achievements include:

Managing polymorphic objects using the vector container of the STL, showcasing proficiency in utilizing containers and their iterators, specifically vectors and lists.

Successfully moving dynamically allocated objects into a container, reflecting a sound understanding of resource management and the principles of object ownership.

Implementing range-based iteration on objects within a container, showcasing mastery of modern C++ practices for enhanced code readability and efficiency.

Demonstrating the ability to report and handle exceptions, a crucial aspect of robust error handling in larger applications, signaling an adept comprehension of exception mechanisms.

Despite the considerable workload, particularly amid midterm preparations and a delayed start, the challenges were met with adept problem-solving skills. Noteworthy was the ease with which container-related tasks were addressed, highlighting a solid grasp of STL containers, vectors, lists, and iterators.
