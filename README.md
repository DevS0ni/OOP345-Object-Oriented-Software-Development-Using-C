# OOP345 - Object-Oriented Software Development Using C

This repository contains all of my code programs and work which I performed in the above mentioned course.

----------------------------------------
Course Description
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...
```
  * expand the skill-set in object-oriented programming and introduce threaded programming.
  * learn to model relationships between classes using containers, inheritance hierarchies and
    polymorphism in the C++ programming language and to write C++ programs that execute on multiple threads.
  * Design collections of model objects using sequential containers and multi-dimensional arrays to solve a systems or business problem
  * Create function objects and closures to customize a programming solution for a particular application
  * Model generalization and specialization using inheritance hierarchies to minimize the duplication of code
  * Model polymorphic behavior using interfaces, virtual functions and templates (generics) to amplify the reusability of code
  * Implement design components using algorithms of the standard template library to utilize existing technologies
  * Create program components of quadratic complexity to solve non-linear problems
  * Design program components using raw pointers and pointer arithmetic to access data in program memory
  * Design multi-tasked solutions using threading libraries to improve the performance of a program
  * Design file stream objects to backup text and binary data for future restoration
  * Execute mathematical operations accurately.
  * Apply a systematic approach to solve problems.
  * Use a variety of thinking skills to anticipate and solve problems.
  * Locate, select, organize, and document information using appropriate technology and information systems.
  * Analyze, evaluate, and apply relevant information from a variety of sources.
  * Interact with others in groups or teams in ways that contribute to effective working relationships and the achievement of goals.
  * Manage the use of time and other resources to complete projects.

* Logic – 16%
    * expressions
        * precedence
        * lvalues and rvalues

        * pre-fix (increment, decrement,
        * unary (sizeof, logical, bit-wise negation, arithmetic negation, arithmetic plus, address of, indirection, cast, noexcept, throw)
        * binary (arithmetic, bit-shifting, relational, bit-wise and, bit-wise or, bit-wise exclusive-or, logical, assignment, sequential, mixed-type expressions, good design)
